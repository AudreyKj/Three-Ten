# ThreeTen

[THREE TEN](https://www.syntheticvelvet-threeten.com/) is a creative website themed around the hour 3:10 pm. It is the second issue of online magazine synthetic velvet I founded in 2018.

synthetic velvet is a creative project that imaginatively explores the concept of time. Each issue takes the form of a website and is themed around one specific hour.

This website is an imaginative exploration of the time 3:10 pm; it features digital creative works, all inspired by this time.

My role involved designing and developing the website as well as coordinating its production. Other artists collaborated, creating creative content: Mio Ary with the participation of Adam, Izumi, Kohki Hasei, Kondo, Masako, Pianola, and Tatsuhiko, Sofia Hjortberg, Camila Malenchini, Pauline Maure, Madrona Redhawk, Majla Zeneli.

Since launching, synthetic velvet has been exhibited as a part of the Vorspiel program organized by digital culture festivals CTM and Transmediale as well as in the [VABF exhibition in Vancouver](http://vancouverartbookfair.com/19/about/).
